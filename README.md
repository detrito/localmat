========

LocalMat is a MVC (Model View Controller) web application created to manage the
equipement of caving organisations.

First, enter the Categories (e.g. helmet, rope, ...) and the Fields
(i.e the types of Attributes, e.g. brand, cord length, serial number, year of
introduction, ...) that you wish. You can then start to add some Articles to
those Categories. These Articles can be browsed and listed by their status
(borrowed or available) and by their Attributes. Users can borrow and return the
Articles, and their History can also be visualised.

A demonstration-website is available at http://localmat-demo.speleo-lausanne.ch

LocalMat is written in PHP and is based on the [Laravel](http://laravel.com)
framework. LocalMat requires PHP >= 5.3.7 and MySQL. The source code is
